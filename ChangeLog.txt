# Forked Here Since Version 1.7.1

Versions 1.7.1 and upwards released by leehodson AKA [@VR51]. Version 1.7.1 began as a fork of version 1.6.6 of WP Favorite Posts. The original release can be found at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-favorite-posts/changelog/.

This fork is maintained by [@vr51] AKA Lee Hodson.

The objectives of this fork are:

	a) To convert the admin pages to Admin Page Framework and thereby improve scope for future enhancements.
	b) Merge edits made in other forks of WP Favorite Posts into this version (where those edits improve code/features).
	c) Add new features.

For help with Admin Page Framework, if you create your own fork or want to add your own features, that is, see
