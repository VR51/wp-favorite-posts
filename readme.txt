<h2>How to Display a Users Most Favorite Post List</h2>

Use the plugin settings under <strong>Settings > WP Favorite Posts</strong> to configure where the favorite buttons display and how they display or use the shortcode [wpfp-link] to add the buttons manually in a page or post.

List a users favorite posts using the shortcode [wp-favorite-posts] in a page. There is a widget for this too.

List the most favorite posts ever (statistics need to be enabled) using the shortcode [wpfp-most number='5'] where number='5' is the number of favorite posts to show.

Text labels can be configured in the plugin settings or you can use a translation file if you prefer.

<h2>Developers</h2>

Add the favorite post buttons and lists to template files using the following functions.

Use `<?php if (function_exists('wpfp_link')) { wpfp_link(); } ?>` to manually add the favorite post buttons to post and page templates.

Use `<?php if (function_exists('wpfp_list_most_favorited')) {wpfp_list_most_favorited( $number ); } ?>` in your theme template to display the most favorited posts ever. The number determines the number of items displayed.

Use the code `<?php if (function_exists('wpfp_list_favorite_posts()')) { wpfp_list_favorite_posts()(); } ?>`

Place custom display templates into your theme or child theme's root directory. Existing templates are in wp-favorite-posts/templates/. They are:

- wpfp-page-template.php
- wpfp-most-favorited-template.php
- wpfp-widget-template.php
- wpfp-most-favorited-dashboard-widget-template.php
